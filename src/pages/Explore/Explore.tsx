              <h3> Spirits of Africa - The Journey</h3>
              <p>
                The future is brighter than ever for the African youths. In this
                journey, we will lay out our future plans, concepts, ideas, and
                dreams that we will be accomplishing as we progress forward with
                this project.This section of the journey will cover things that
                will happen in the near future of our project.

              <h3> Phase 1: "Our Humble Beginning"</h3>
              <p>
                Finally, we are tired of it all, tired of our histories not
                being represented rightly, tired of it being stolen from us and
                we have come to take a stand and tell our stories ourselves, we
                will represent ourselves and teach the world what we really
                stand for. In this phase, the server slowly begins to enlist
                members into the presale, the First Sons are locked in and
                prepared to go hunt for the SOA! We will be throwing out sneak
                peaks, putting the project together, and preparing for a great
                journey ahead.

              <p>
                During this time, the whitelists will be full, presale and
                public launch will be scheduled, mint prices, project details
                and more will all be confirmed, now we we can walk with the
                Spirits! In this phase, minting will happen. As we get closer to
                selling out, future plans will start rolling out and
                implementation will start, and at this stage we get to realise,
                that there is more for the Youths Of Africa.

              <p>
                After everything is prepared by the Team, minting commences! We
                will first allow the Founders mint to ensure everything is under
                control, then our First Sons, and then we will have a Public
                Sale. The 3,333 god in this collection will be called "Sango".
                Sango will be the core of this project. Only with Sango you will
                have access to the perks and holder's benefits. Sango will be
                extremely important to our project and vision. After all 3,333
                are minted out - we move forward and meet other Spirits.{' '}

                After all 3,333 Sango Collection is minted out, then we will
                begin to roll out premium artwork for different African gods.
                This will not be a collection, they are single artworks of an
                African Gods. While this is going on, our African Youth
                Empowerment plans will kick off also.

              <p>
                At this junction, we know we have come a long way and we are
                satisfied with all we have accomplished as a community, as an
                African and finally, it genuinely feels good to be represented
                and presented well to the whole word. We earned it, now we walk
                into the Spirit Land, as we onboard our community, into the
                metaverse and grow the community into something much more
                bigger. Now we can enjoy all that we have worked together to
                build. Now we ourselves are the Spirits Of Africa as we spread
                love all over Africa.
              </p>
              <p>
                We plan to achieve these goals without leaving a single
                community member behind, except those that decides to leave.
