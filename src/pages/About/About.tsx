	<h3>
	  <b>Goals:</b>
	</h3>
	<p>
	  African myth is so interesting but does not get the recognition it
	  deserves. Our goal at SoA is to make give the whole world the
	  opportunity to enjoy African myth through NFT's. We have so many
	  beautiful untold and poorly expressed stories about Africa and
	  African myth, that's our inspiration at SoA. We want to be a
	  source of hope to the African Community, helping people all over
	  the world understand and enjoy Africa by making sure that l the
	  world gets to know more about the true African stories, how it
	  happened, when it happened and where it happened.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>SOA</b> is a project for the people and will forever support
	  the people of Africa by telling our story through NFT.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Come aboard and join us tell these stories and shine the light on
	  Africa.
